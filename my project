There is no programming code to calculate a square of a planet, as planets do not have a concept of "square" in their context. However, if you meant to calculate the square of a number representing a planet's orbital distance or other numerical property, you can use the following code examples in different programming languages:

1. **C Program to Calculate Square of a Number** [source](https://www.tutorialgateway.org/c-program-to-calculate-square-of-a-number/)
```c
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
    int number, Square;
    printf(" \n Please Enter an Integer Number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number);
    Square = Calculate_Square(number);
    printf("\n Square of %d is = %d", number, Square);
    return 0;
}
int Calculate_Square(int Number) {
    return Number * Number;
}
```

2. **Python Program to Calculate Square of a Given Number** [source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-profram-to-calculate-square-of-a-given-number/)
```python
def square(number):
    return number * number

number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print("Square of", number, "is", square(number))
```

3. **C Program: Find the square of any number** [source](https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/function/c-function-exercise-2.php)
```c
#include<stdio.h>
double square(double num);
int main() {
    double num, result;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &num);
    result = square(num);
    printf("Square of %.2lf is %.2lf", num, result);
    return 0;
}
double square(double Number) {
    return Number * Number;
}
```

These code examples demonstrate how to write a program in C and Python to calculate the square of a given number. You can modify the input to represent a planet's numerical property and then calculate its square using these programs.
